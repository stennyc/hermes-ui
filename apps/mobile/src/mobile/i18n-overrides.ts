/**
 * i18n-overrides — mobile-only wording tweaks.
 *
 * The mobile app bundles the desktop renderer and shares its i18n catalog. A few
 * strings describe mouse/keyboard gestures that don't exist on a phone, so we
 * override them here for touch. The I18nProvider reads `TRANSLATIONS[locale]` by
 * reference (no clone), so mutating the catalog before the app renders is enough.
 * This is imported only by the mobile entry — the desktop build is untouched.
